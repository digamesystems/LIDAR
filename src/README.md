### Abstract: 

Found herein are source files for the project, including the main application(s), and example programs that demonstrate how to work with the various sensors / modules we are using. 

* [SerialToSerialBT](https://github.com/digamesystems/LIDAR/tree/main/src/SerialToSerialBT) This example code is in the Public Domain (or CC0 licensed, at your option.) By Evandro Copercini - 2018. This example creates a bridge between Serial and Classical Bluetooth (SPP) and also demonstrate that SerialBT have the same functionalities of a normal Serial
* [esp32_bluetooth_tester](https://github.com/digamesystems/LIDAR/tree/main/src/esp32_bluetooth_tester) A little app to test Bluetooth connectivity range. Make a Bluetooth connection to the device "ShuttleCounter" with [Serial BlueTooth Terminal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kai_morich.serial_bluetooth_terminal&hl=en_US&gl=US). The device will issue a count value every second. 
* [esp32_people_counter](https://github.com/digamesystems/LIDAR/tree/main/src/esp32_people_counter) A LIDAR-Based people counting system for shuttle buses.
* [esp32_tfminiplus_correlation_test](https://github.com/digamesystems/LIDAR/tree/main/src/esp32_tfminiplus_correlation_test) Testing algorithms that use correlation techniques for Vehicle Detection.
* [esp32_tfminiplus_example](https://github.com/digamesystems/LIDAR/tree/main/src/esp32_tfminiplus_example) A little program to show how to work with the TFMini-Plus LIDAR sensor.
* [esp32_ttminiplus_sd_ds3231](https://github.com/digamesystems/LIDAR/tree/main/src/esp32_ttminiplus_sd_ds3231) The HEIMDALL vehicle counting application.
